### Week 02
We work on the creation of the index.html file.

### Week 03
In this week, we apply styles to the html created last week to make it look like the figma screenflow, with the learned properties, but without using flexbox. We add styles to the project creating css folder with this files:
+ [reset.css](https://github.com/TomasBettini/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/blob/master/Semana-03/css/reset.css) 
+ [style.css](https://github.com/TomasBettini/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/blob/master/Semana-03/css/style.css)

### Week 04
Now, we replicate the figma screenflow, but using flexbox as the main property, starting with the mobile first concept.

### Week 05
In this week, we learned some basic concepts about javascript, for which we did some practice exercises. The result of these can be viewed at: https://tomasbettini.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-05/index.html

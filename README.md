### Week 03
In this week, we apply styles to the html created last week to make it look like the figma screenflow, with the learned properties, but without using flexbox. We add styles to the project creating css folder with this files:
+ [reset.css](https://github.com/TomasBettini/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/blob/master/Semana-03/css/reset.css) 
+ [style.css](https://github.com/TomasBettini/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/blob/master/Semana-03/css/style.css)

### Week 04
Now, we replicate the figma screenflow, but using flexbox as the main property, starting with the mobile first concept.

### Week 05
In this week, we learned some basic concepts about javascript, for which we did some practice exercises. The result of these can be viewed at: https://tomasbettini.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-05/index.html

### Week 06
We create the files login.html and sign-up.html so that the user can log in and register. To perform the validations we use the concepts learned from javascript. Also the styles were added with the login.css and sign-up.css files. You can see the codes here:
